  which means Pasig. The Diocese of Pasig (Latin: Dioecesis Pasiginae) is one of the Dioceses of the Catholic Church in the Philippines that comprises the City of Pasig, 
  Taguig (with the exemptions of the EMBO barangays (formerly part of Makati City), which are under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Manila), 
  and the Municipality of Pateros in Metro Manila, Philippines. The Diocese of Pasig was established on June 28, 2003, by the late St. Pope John Paul II and the papal bull Dei Caritas (John Paul II, 2003). 
  It was formally and canonically erected on August 21, 2003, with the installation of Most. Rev. Francisco C. San Diego, D.D. as its first bishop. 
  The Immaculate Conception Cathedral-Parish, located in the central vicinity of Pasig, was made the cathedral or the seat of the diocese. 
  Today, Most. Rev. Mylo Hubert C. Vergara, D.D. is the current and second bishop of the diocese. The Diocese of Pasig comprises four vicariates: the Vicariate of St. Anne (Taguig and Pateros), the Vicariate of Immaculate Conception (Pasig), and the Vicariate of Sto. Niño (Taguig), and the Vicariate of Sto. Tomás de Villanueva (Pasig).<br/> 
  
  <br/>Prior to the establishment as a local church, the present-day Diocese of Pasig used to be a part of the

  The oldest parishes, built during the Spanish colonialization period, were in Pasig (Immaculate Conception), Pateros (San Roque), and Taguig (Saint Anne). In 1953, the community of Santolan, Pasig was granted a parish of their own, Santo Tomas de Villanueva Parish, which was followed by the establishment of new parishes in Rosario and Bicutan (1963), 
  Tipas and Bagong Ilog (1969), and Barrio Capitolyo (1976). The northeastern side of Pasig, which comprises the barangays of Manggahan, Santolan, De La Paz, Santa Lucia, and Rosario, was given to the newly established

  Between 1985 and 1995, six chapels of the Immaculate Conception Parish were elevated as independent parishes.<br/>​<br/>Parishes belonging to the Vicariate of the Immaculate Conception and to the municipalities of Taguig and Pateros were part of the Ecclesiastical District of Makati, which was then headed by Manila Auxiliary Bishop

  The military chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption in Fort Bonifacio was turned over by the Military Ordinariate to the Archdiocese of Manila in 2000 and was renamed Saint Michael Chaplaincy.
